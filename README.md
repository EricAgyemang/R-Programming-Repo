# R-Programming-Repo

IT 497 - Introduction To Research Methodology-Department: Information Technology

# Description:
Introduction to the design and evaluation of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies; introduction and practice of technical and research writing. 

# Basic Features of R
In the early days, a key feature of R was that its syntax is very similar to S, making it easy for
S-PLUS users to switch over. While the R’s syntax is nearly identical to that of S’s, R’s semantics,
while superficially similar to S, are quite different. In fact, R is technically much closer to the Scheme
language than it is to the original S language when it comes to how R works under the hood.
Today R runs on almost any standard computing platform and operating system. Its open source
nature means that anyone is free to adapt the software to whatever platform they choose. Indeed, R
has been reported to be running on modern tablets, phones, PDAs, and game consoles.

# Design of the R System
The primary R system is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, also known as
CRAN. CRAN also hosts many add-on packages that can be used to extend the functionality of R.
The R system is divided into 2 conceptual parts:
1. The “base” R system that you download from CRAN: Linux Windows Mac Source Code.
2. Everything else.

R functionality is divided into a number of packages.
When you download a fresh installation of R from CRAN, you get all of the above, which represents
a substantial amount of functionality. However, there are many other packages available:

# Limitations of R
No programming language or statistical analysis system is perfect. R certainly has a number of
drawbacks. For starters, R is essentially based on almost 50 year old technology, going back to the
original S system developed at Bell Labs. There was originally little built in support for dynamic or
3-D graphics (but things have improved greatly since the “old days”).

# R Resources
# Official Manuals
As far as getting started with R by reading stuff, there is of course this book. Also, available from
CRAN¹⁶ are
• An Introduction to R
• R Data Import/Export
• Writing R Extensions: Discusses how to write and organize R packages
• R Installation and Administration: This is mostly for building R from the source code)
• R Internals: This manual describes the low level structure of R and is primarily for developers
and R core members
• R Language Definition: This documents the R language and, again, is primarily for developers
